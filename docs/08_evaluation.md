# 8. Evaluation of Response Strategies and Recommendations for Future Prevention

While Medibank's response strategies demonstrated commendable aspects such as prompt detection and transparent communication, there are opportunities for improvement. Post-attack communications should provide customers with more detailed information to enhance transparency and rebuild trust. Additionally, adopting a more proactive approach to crisis management can help identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious actors.

To prevent similar incidents in the future, Medibank should prioritize strengthening its cybersecurity infrastructure through a combination of technical controls, employee training, and vendor management practices. This includes updating network security measures, conducting regular security assessments, and establishing robust incident response protocols to facilitate timely detection and containment of cyber threats.

Moreover, Medibank should enhance collaboration with third-party service providers and implement stricter security protocols to mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks. Finally, the adoption of automated security tools and processes can streamline incident detection and response efforts, enabling Medibank to effectively safeguard against evolving cyber threats and bolster its overall cybersecurity resilience.

These recommendations, when implemented effectively, will empower Medibank to mitigate the likelihood of future cyberattacks and safeguard the sensitive information entrusted to its care.
